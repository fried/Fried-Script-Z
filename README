Fried Script Z .zshrc

.zshrc - The Main ZSH Config file
.zsh.d/ - Plugin Directory
    git-promt.z - Optional Git Branch in Right Prompt
    shortpwd.z - Shorten Long PWD's by including ,.. in the middle of them.
    tmux.z - Examples of loading tmux, and fixing your SSH agent in tmux

 All .z files in the plugin directory will be loaded after sourcing .zshrc.local unless you add the files name to a special array
    .zshrc.local eq.  NO_FRIED_LOAD+='tmux' #This will not load the tmux.z script if it exists 

History> 
This script is a re-write of my startup script for tcsh/csh, When I started at Facebook I decided it was time to get more modern with my choice of unix shell.
This version should be a work-alike to my tcsh/csh startup. 

My current environment consists of Linux and MacOS X, so these two will have the best support. 

To update to the latest version you can use 'getzshrc [branch]' which will pull from the github stable branch by default, One important difference from my previous script
is that this proccess does not automaticly source the new .zshrc file it offers you a chance to view a diff first and or revert. 

use .zshrc.local for system specific configurations, these will not be wiped out by a 'getzshrc'

TODO:
    Look at custom completions in zsh, relying on some defaults right now

Current Version 1.2
    Added support for automaticlly sourcing .z files in .zsh.d unless the name of the file is in the array $NO_FRIED_LOAD

Version 1.1.1b
    Removed . from path, this is a security issue on shared hosts, you can add this to you .zshrc.local if it bothers you
