History> 
This script is a re-write of my startup script for tcsh/csh, When I started at Facebook I decided it was time to get more modern with my choice of unix shell.
This version should be a work-alike to my tcsh/csh startup. 

My current environment consists of Linux and MacOS X, so these two will have the best support. 

To update to the latest version you can use 'getzshrc [branch]' which will pull from the github stable branch by default, One important difference from my previous script
is that this proccess does not automaticly source the new .zshrc file it offers you a chance to view a diff first and or revert. 

use .zshrc.local for system specific configurations, these will not be wiped out by a 'getzshrc'

TODO:
    Look at custom completions in zsh, relying on some defaults right now

Current Version 1.1.1b
    Removed . from path, this is a security issue on shared hosts, you can add this to you .zshrc.local if it bothers you
