.zshrc - The Main ZSH Config file
.zsh.d/ - Plugin Directory
    git-promt.z - Optional Git Branch in Right Prompt
    shortpwd.z - Shorten Long PWD's by including ,.. in the middle of them.
    tmux.z - Examples of loading tmux, and fixing your SSH agent in tmux

All .z files in the plugin directory will be loaded after sourcing .zshrc.local
unless you add the files name to a special array in .zshrc.local
   eq.
      NO_FRIED_LOAD+='tmux' #This will not load the tmux.z script if it exists

History>
This script is a re-write of my startup script for tcsh/csh, When I started at
Facebook I decided it was time to get more modern with my choice of unix shell.
This version should be a work-alike to my tcsh/csh startup.

My current environment consists of Linux and MacOS X, so these two will have
the best support.

To update to the latest version you can use 'getzshrc [branch]' which will pull
from the github stable branch by default, One important difference from my
previous script is that this proccess does not automaticly source the new
.zshrc file it offers you a chance to view a diff first and or revert.

use .zshrc.local for system specific configurations, these will not be wiped
out by a 'getzshrc'

TODO:
    Look at custom completions in zsh, relying on some defaults right now

Current Version 22.01
    Fixed path builder to have proper binary directory priorities
    Fixed indentation issues and whitespace on line ends
    Added vim tabstop definition
    Fixed `ped` alias for Darwin
    Updated URLs for changes from github.com
    Since I havent updated in 10 years I moved to date based versioning :P

Version 1.2
   [e] fixed an issue with the pwget alias using incorrect syntax
   [d] Changed history to not update after every command should help with flaky
       NFS home directories
   [c] For NFS home environments load a file ~/.zshrc.<hostname>
   [b] changed the way history file is writen, so that the log file is written
       after each commnad. This saved history has been expanded to 10,000 and
       you can load history from other shells when you want with 'loadhistory'
   [a] Added -U on the typeset for all the function hooks, so hooks didn't get
       added multiple times after reloads
    Added support for automaticlly sourcing .z files in .zsh.d unless the name
     of the file is in the array $NO_FRIED_LOAD
    Turning of NOMATCH zsh option by default. This behavior is more like my
     .cshrc

Version 1.1.1b
    Removed . from path, this is a security issue on shared hosts, you can add
    this to you .zshrc.local if it bothers you
